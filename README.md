# Project Overview
This project involves a security audit of the Google Gruyere web application, which is intentionally vulnerable application designed by Google for educational purposes, allowing users to learn about common web vulnerabilities in a controlled, sandboxed environment. This audit identifies and assesses security risks within the application, using a risk-based classification to prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation.

The assessment is strictly limited to the https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/ application, conducted within the boundaries allowed by the application owner and without interference with Google's critical infrastructure.
## Notice: This audit is for educational use only and does not intend to harm Google or its infrastructure.
